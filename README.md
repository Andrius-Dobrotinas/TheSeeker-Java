# TheSeeker-Java
A Java version of the file search tool that I originally wrote in C# (https://github.com/Andrius-Dobrotinas/TheSeeker)

This goal of this project is, first of all, for me to do some real life coding in Java, and also to practice Test Driven Development.

TODO: write GUI components.
